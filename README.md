# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project
In this project, I explored a dataset from Kaggle to predict customer churn in a bank. The dataset contains various features related to customer behavior, such as account balance, transaction history, and customer demographics.
Project Highlights:
Objective: Predict whether a customer will churn (leave) the bank based on available features.
Dataset: The dataset includes information about customers’ interactions with the bank.
Machine Learning Model: I built and trained a machine learning model using RandomForestClassifier
Evaluation: I evaluated the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results: The model achieved an accuracy of 86% on the test set.
GitHub Repository: You can find the complete code and Jupyter Notebook in my GitHub repository here.
